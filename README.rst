stan-examples
=============
A collection of example Stan models for inspiration.

Resources
---------
- `Stan reference manual: <http://mc-stan.org/users/documentation/>`_ the Bible of the Stan modelling language. There is a 90% probability it has a solution to your problem (if only you could find where).
- `Stan forums: <https://discourse.mc-stan.org/>`_ the official Stan discourse. Active and friendly community with relatively fast response times.
- `Stan case studies: <http://mc-stan.org/users/documentation/case-studies>`_ many helpful and detailed demonstrations of Stan use cases. Be sure to look at the robust workflow examples for `PyStan <http://mc-stan.org/users/documentation/case-studies/pystan_workflow.html>`_ and `RStan <http://mc-stan.org/users/documentation/case-studies/rstan_workflow.html>`_.
- `Stan prior recommendations: <https://github.com/stan-dev/stan/wiki/Prior-Choice-Recommendations>`_ recommendations for priors from Stan team. Always being updated (for better or worse).
- `Stan example models: <https://github.com/stan-dev/example-models>`_ a veritable treasure trove of prewritten Stan models across a wide array of statistical problems.
- `ShinyStan: <http://mc-stan.org/users/interfaces/shinystan>`_ helpful visualization tools compatible with RStan.
- `ArviZ: <https://github.com/arviz-devs/arviz>`_ helpful visualization tools compatible with PyStan.
- `hBayesDM: <https://github.com/CCS-Lab/hBayesDM>`_ user-friendly R package that offers hierarchical Bayesian analysis of various computational cognitive models for many decision-making tasks.
- `stantools: <https://github.com/szorowi1/stantools>`_ some custom pystan-related functions I found myself writing over and over again collected in one repository.
